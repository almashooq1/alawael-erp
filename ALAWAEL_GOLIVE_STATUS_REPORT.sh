DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY
═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Primary Strategy: Blue-Green Deployment (Recommended)
  ✓ Zero-downtime deployment
  ✓ Instant rollback (RTO <3 min)
  ✓ Full production validation before switch
  ✓ Parallel environment support

Alternative Strategy: Canary Deployment
  ✓ Gradual rollout (5% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
  ✓ Safe testing in production
  ✓ Suitable for staging deployment
  ✓ Lower risk for initial rollout

Backup Strategy: Rolling Deployment
  ✓ Service-by-service update (8 services)
  ✓ Continuous availability maintained
  ✓ Slightly longer deployment time
  ✓ Better for complex systems

Rollback Strategy: Instant Revert
  ✓ Single command execution: bash alawael-deployment.sh rollback production
  ✓ Execution time: <3 minutes
  ✓ Data preservation: 100% guaranteed
  ✓ No manual intervention required


TIMELINE TO PRODUCTION
