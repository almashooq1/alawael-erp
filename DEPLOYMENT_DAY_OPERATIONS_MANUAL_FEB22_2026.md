```

### CRITICAL: THE 5-SECOND SWITCH
```
⚠️  THIS MOMENT IS CRITICAL ⚠️

T - 5 sec: Ready?
           → DevOps confirms GREEN health check PASS
           → Load balancer ready to switch
           → All monitoring active
           → Team ready

T - 0 sec: EXECUTE SWITCH
           Command: bash alawael-phase4-switch-to-green.sh
           Action: DNS + Load Balancer updated
           Result: Traffic flows to GREEN

T + 1 sec: VERIFY SWITCH
           → Is traffic on GREEN?
           → Monitoring shows 100% traffic routed?
           → Response times normal?
           
T + 5 sec: SMOKE TEST
           → Can we access application?
           → Are health checks passing?
           → Any errors in logs?

T + 30 sec: BREATHING ROOM
           → Still all green?
           → Customer reports coming in?
           → Ready to monitor for hours?

IF ANYTHING WRONG:
  Execute: bash alawael-phase4-rollback-to-blue.sh
  Time: < 30 seconds total
  Result: Back on BLUE (old version)
  Impact: Zero downtime (switch back is same <5 sec)
```

### DURING PHASE 4: CRITICAL DECISIONS

#### At 5-Minute Mark
```
DECISION POINT: Any issues yet?

✅ All green? → Continue monitoring
⚠️  Minor warning? → Continue, but watch closely
🚨 Critical error? → EXECUTE ROLLBACK NOW
```

#### At 10-Minute Mark  
```
DECISION POINT: Still looking good?

✅ All nominal? → Confidence growing
⚠️  Still some issue? → Investigate quickly
🚨 Customer reports? → Escalate immediately
```

#### At 15-Minute Mark
```
DECISION POINT: Are we stable?

✅ Stable for 15 min? → Phase 4 usually safe now
⚠️  Just stabilized? → Continue watching
🚨 Getting worse? → ROLLBACK WINDOW CLOSING (5 min left)
```

#### At 25-Minute Mark
```
DECISION POINT: Final 5 minutes before completion

✅ Excellent condition? → Phase 4 nearly complete
⚠️  Any issues now? → Rollback last chance (< 5 min window)
🚨 Critical error? → MUST ROLLBACK IMMEDIATELY
```

#### At 30-Minute Mark
```
✅ PHASE 4 COMPLETE!

BLUE environment is now decommissioned
GREEN environment is now LIVE
v1.0.0 is officially in production
```

### Post-Phase 4 Actions
```
Immediately after (14:30 PM):
- Confirm traffic 100% on GREEN
- Run smoke tests again
- Document rollback did NOT occur
- Send "Phase 4 SUCCESS!" Slack message
- Brief executive team
- Team celebrates! 🎉🎉🎉

Next 30 minutes:
- Continue monitoring
- Check for any user reports
- Verify all features working
- Monitor error logs

Next 2 hours:

- Team transitions to Phase 5 monitoring
- Operations assumes steady-state monitoring
- DevOps team goes on-call (instead of active)

Final documentation:
- Save all logs
- Document timeline
- Record metrics for post-mortem
- Archive deployment report
```

## EMERGENCY: INSTANT ROLLBACK PROCEDURE

### When to Rollback
```
AUTOMATIC ROLLBACK TRIGGERS:
☐ Error rate > 2% (sustained for 2 min)
☐ Response time > 1000ms (sustained for 2 min)
☐ Database connections failing
☐ Critical security alert
☐ Payment system failures
☐ Authentication system down
☐ Manual decision by DevOps lead
```

### How to Rollback (Takes < 30 Seconds)
```bash
# STEP 1: Execute rollback script (takes 5 seconds)
cd c:\Users\x-be\OneDrive\المستندات\04-10-2025\66666
bash alawael-phase4-production-rollback.sh

# STEP 2: Verify rollback (takes 10 seconds)
# Monitoring shows: GREEN → BLUE
# Customer traffic: Returns to BLUE (v1.0.0 old)
# Load balancer: Updated
# DNS: Propagated (usually instant)

# STEP 3: Confirm (takes 5 seconds)
# Check monitoring dashboard
# Verify traffic on BLUE
# Error rate back to normal

# STEP 4: Status update (takes 10 seconds)
# Slack: "🚨 ROLLBACK EXECUTED - Back on v1.0.0 stable version"
# VP Ops: Call with status update
# Team: Discussion of what went wrong
```

### Rollback Success Criteria
```
Check these within 30 seconds:

✅ Load balancer pointing to BLUE? 
✅ 100% traffic on BLUE?
✅ Error rate drops below 0.1%?
✅ Response time < 200ms?
✅ Health checks passing?
✅ No critical errors in logs?
✅ Customers can access the system?

If all YES → Rollback successful ✅
If any NO → Escalate to VP Operations 🚨
