## ⏰ TIME OPTIMIZATION

### Parallel Work (Not Recommended)
- Can't run multiple major integrations simultaneously
- Code conflicts likely
- Testing becomes complex
- Recommended: Sequential execution

### Best Sequence (11.5-17.5 hours total)
```
1. Security (4-6 hours)    → GDPR + compliance ✅
2. CI/CD (5-7 hours)       → Automation ready ✅
3. Features (4-8 hours)    → New capabilities ✅

Total: ~13-21 hours work = 2-3 days at 8 hours/day
```

### Fast Track (Just What's Essential)
```
1. Security (4-6 hours)    → Critical for compliance
2. CI/CD (5-7 hours)       → Critical for productivity
~11-13 hours total = 1.5-2 days
```

### Minimal Track (Quickest)
```
1. Option E (CI/CD)        → 5-7 hours
You get deployed pipeline but no new security
~5-7 hours total = 1 day
```
