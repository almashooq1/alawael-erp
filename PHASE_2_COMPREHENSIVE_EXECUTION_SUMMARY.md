→ Skim the 6 sections for overview
→ Note the 3-5 day timeline
```

### Step 2: Understand Your Path (2 minutes)
```
Choose your infrastructure options:

```
Option 1: Solo (3-5 days)
  Person A: Does MongoDB → Redis → Email → Monitoring → Security
  
Option 2: Two People (Parallel, 2-3 days)
  Person A: MongoDB + Redis (Day 1)
  Person B: Email + Monitoring (Day 1)
  Both: Security + Validation (Day 2-3)
  
Option 3: Three People (Parallel, 1-2 days)
  Person A: MongoDB
  Person B: Redis + Email
  Person C: Monitoring + Security
  All: Validation (Day 3)
```

**Recommended:** 2 people, working in parallel, 2-3 days total
