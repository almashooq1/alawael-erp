# ✓ Repository structures validated
# ✓ Files synced to project directories
```

#### **Phase 2: Staging Deployment & Tests (1-2 hours)**

```bash
# Step 2: Deploy to staging and run complete test suite
chmod +x staging-deployment-and-tests.sh
./staging-deployment-and-tests.sh

# Automated Steps:
#   → Pre-deployment checks ✓
#   → Build backend ✓
#   → Build ERP ✓
#   → Unit tests ✓
#   → Integration tests ✓
#   → Linting ✓
#   → Smoke tests ✓
#   → Generate report ✓

# Expected Result:
# ✓ All 45+ tests passing
# ✓ Coverage >95%
# ✓ Performance baselines met
# ✓ Zero lint errors
```

#### **Phase 3: End-to-End Validation (45 minutes)**

```bash
# Step 3: Run comprehensive E2E validation
chmod +x end-to-end-integration-validation.sh
./end-to-end-integration-validation.sh

# Automated Validation:
#   → System startup ✓
#   → API endpoints (5 endpoints tested) ✓
#   → Database operations ✓
#   → Performance metrics ✓
#   → Security checks ✓
#   → Integration tests ✓
#   → Generate report ✓

# Expected Result:
# ✓ All systems operational
# ✓ 95.6%+ pass rate
# ✓ No critical issues
# ✓ Security validation passed
# ✓ Performance within targets
```

#### **Phase 4: Production Approval Decision (30 minutes)**

```bash
# Step 4: Make final GO/NO-GO decision
chmod +x final-go-no-go-decision-maker.sh
./final-go-no-go-decision-maker.sh

# Decision Process:
#   1. Pre-deployment checklist (20 items)
#   2. Risk assessment scoring
#   3. Stakeholder approvals (3 required)
#   4. Final GO/NO-GO determination
#   5. Deployment authorization

# Expected Decision:
# ✓ GO - Approve for production
#   OR
# ⚠️  NO-GO - Address items, reschedule
```

#### **Phase 5: Production Deployment (1-2 hours)**

```bash
# Step 5: Deploy to production (if GO decision made)
chmod +x advanced-deploy.sh
./advanced-deploy.sh

# Automated Deployment:
#   → Backup production database ✓
#   → Deploy to staging first ✓
#   → Run health checks ✓
#   → Deploy to production ✓
#   → Run smoke tests ✓
#   → Monitor for 1 hour ✓
#   → Create GitHub release ✓
#   → Notify team ✓
```

#### **Phase 6: Post-Deployment Monitoring (24+ hours)**
