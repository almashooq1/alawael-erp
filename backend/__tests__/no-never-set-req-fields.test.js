/**
 * Drift guard — generalizes W269h (`req.branchId`) to the whole class:
 * a route/service that READS `req.<field>` for a field NO middleware ever SETS
 * gets `undefined` → a silent leak/bug. Found by a load-based scan that diffed
 * every `req.X` read in routes against every `req.X =` write backend-wide + the
 * Express built-ins.
 *
 * Two never-set fields surfaced (besides the W269h `req.branchId`, guarded
 * separately):
 *
 *   1. `req.effectiveBranchId` — set by no middleware. iq-assessments used it for
 *      the new assessment's branchId (`req.effectiveBranchId || req.user?.branchId`,
 *      and `req.user.branchId` is ALSO never populated) → branchId persisted as
 *      undefined. FIXED to the canonical `effectiveBranchScope(req)`. This guard
 *      keeps it at ZERO.
 *
 *   2. `req.mfaActor` — SECURITY FINDING, intentionally NOT auto-fixed here.
 *      The canonical MFA context is `req.actor` with `.mfaLevel` (populated by
 *      middleware/mfa-actor.js + middleware/requireMfaTier.js; `mfaLevel` and the
 *      routes' `tier` are the same 0–3 scale). 4 sites read the non-existent
 *      `req.mfaActor.tier` (always undefined) and have since W289 (2026-05-23):
 *        - routes/quality/capa.routes.js  (MFA-tier passed to transitionCapaItem)
 *        - routes/risk-sweep.routes.js     (×3: a tier-2 cross-branch grant + TWO
 *          tier<2 cross-branch DEFENSE-IN-DEPTH checks that never fire)
 *      Correcting them to `req.actor.mfaLevel` ACTIVATES dormant security logic
 *      (one grants access, two add cross-branch restrictions — the latter ALSO
 *      compounded by the never-populated `req.user.branchId`, so they need the full
 *      W269 `effectiveBranchScope` treatment, not just a field rename). That is a
 *      security behaviour change requiring the MFA/branch-isolation owner's review,
 *      so it is BASELINED here (ratchet-down) rather than blind-fixed. When fixed,
 *      remove the file from the baseline in the same commit.
