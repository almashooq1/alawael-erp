# Frontend Audit — W356-W370 + W384 Modules

**Type**: Research output (Cycle 2 item #4 from OPEN_ISSUES_INVENTORY.md)
**Date**: 2026-05-25
**Scope**: Verify Next.js 15 pages exist in `alawael-rehab-platform/apps/web-admin/src/app/(dashboard)/` for the 11 W356-W384 clinical-services modules
**Audience**: Product PM + frontend lead (decide if naming cleanup is worth scheduling)

---

## Headline finding

**All 11 modules have complete frontend coverage** (list + detail + new + nav). The original Cycle 2 concern ("what's missing for pilot UX") is resolved: **nothing critical is missing**. Pilot Week 2 can proceed.

The audit surfaced ONE secondary issue worth flagging (naming inconsistency in §3 below).

**Score**: **11/11 modules fully wired**. No new pages to ship.

---

## 2. Aggregator + nav-items.v2.tsx wiring

Both confirmed wired (`grep -E "<module-name>" components/layout/nav-items.v2.tsx`):

- All 11 modules have entries in the clinical section of `nav-items.v2.tsx`
- W390 added caregiver-support as the 8th card in the `/clinical-services/[id]` cross-surface aggregator (per CLAUDE.md addendum)

---

## 3. Secondary finding — naming inconsistency (NOT urgent, decision needed)

Three modules use PLURAL paths while 7 use SINGULAR + 1 is nested. CLAUDE.md's W372 doctrine implied singular, but reality diverged when the modules shipped:

| Backend route            | Frontend path                     | Style         |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------- |
| `/api/seizure-log`       | `/seizure-log`                    | singular      |
| `/api/safeguarding`      | `/safeguarding`                   | singular      |
| `/api/communication-aid` | `/communication-aid`              | singular      |
| `/api/adaptive-sports`   | `/adaptive-sports`                | singular      |
| `/api/respite`           | `/respite`                        | singular      |
| `/api/diet-prescription` | `/diet-prescription`              | singular      |
| `/api/caregiver-support` | `/caregiver-support`              | singular      |
| `/api/assistive-device`  | `/assistive-devices`              | **PLURAL** ⚠ |
| `/api/facility-asset`    | `/facility-assets`                | **PLURAL** ⚠ |
| `/api/transition-plan`   | `/transition-plans`               | **PLURAL** ⚠ |
| `/api/cbahi`             | `/cbahi` + `/cbahi/attestations/` | **nested** ⚠ |

### Decision needed: do we standardise?

**Option A — Leave as-is** (zero work)

- ✓ All routes work, nav-items.v2.tsx is consistent with what exists
- ✓ No breaking change risk
- ✗ Future agents adding pages have no clear convention to follow

**Option B — Move 3 plural paths to singular** (~1 day work)

- Cost: rename 9 page.tsx files (3 modules × 3 pages each) + update nav-items entries + update any deep-links
- Risk: any external bookmark / docs / e2e test that hard-codes `/assistive-devices` etc. breaks
- ✓ Matches W372 doctrine + matches backend route names

**Option C — Update doctrine to allow both, document the rule** (~30 min work)

- Cost: write one paragraph in CLAUDE.md "frontend conventions" section: "use singular for entity-level routes; plural for collection-summary dashboards; nested for sub-resource hierarchies (cbahi → attestations)"
- ✓ Codifies the actual pattern; future agents have rule to follow
- ✗ Existing inconsistency stays; the 3 plural cases stay anomalous

**My recommendation**: **Option C**. The 3 plural paths reflect a real product decision (these ARE collection-summary dashboards — facility-assets manages many assets, transition-plans shows lifetime plans, assistive-devices is a loan catalog). Forcing singular would obscure that semantic. Just document the rule.

## 3.5 IEP frontend path consolidation (ADR-026 no-regrets #4)

The web-admin has TWO paths that both consume IEP backend surfaces:

| Path         | Pages                  | Backend API                                                                    | History                                                                                         | Canonical?                 |
| ------------ | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `/iep/`      | list + detail + new    | `/api/smart-iep` (older, pre-W200b)                                            | Pre-MoE-alignment work                                                                          | ⚠ legacy                  |
| `/iep-plan/` | list + detail (no new) | `/api/v1/iep-plan` (W200b, MoE-aligned with Nafath signatures + 8-domain enum) | Wave 200b explicitly added to avoid `/iep` collision per `features.registry.js:142-143` comment | ✅ canonical going forward |

**Convention going forward** (until ADR-026 resolves):

- New IEP work goes to `/iep-plan/` (W200b MoE-aligned shape)
- `/iep/` (older `/api/smart-iep`) stays for backward compatibility but no new features
- Any deep-link from beneficiary 360, search results, or external bookmarks SHOULD target `/iep-plan/`
- The /iep/ → /iep-plan/ consolidation is contingent on ADR-026 outcome:
  - **Approach A** (consolidate to CarePlanVersion) — both paths eventually deprecate in favour of `/care-plans?planType=iep`
  - **Approach B** (formalize tiers) — /iep-plan/ stays canonical; /iep/ deprecates
  - **Approach C** (adapter + deprecate) — same as A; both go through the adapter

Until the meeting decides, **don't add new features to /iep/**. Future agents picking up frontend IEP work should default to `/iep-plan/`.

## 4. Out of scope but observed

The broader `(dashboard)/` directory has **158 top-level routes**, many of which have list-only pages (no detail/new). Examples:

- `aac/`, `ar-vr/`, `case-management/`, `civil-defense/`, `crm/`, `early-intervention/`, `family-visits/`, `montessori/` — list only
- `audit-trail/`, `bip-tracking/`, `gas/`, `supervisor/` — NO page at all (TypeScript imports only? layouts?)

This is **out of scope for the Cycle 2 audit** (which focused on W356-W384). Categorising those 158 directories into "intentional read-only dashboards" vs "incomplete CRUD" vs "stub for future feature" requires per-domain context that's not in the codebase. Recommend treating as a separate Cycle if you want a full inventory.

---

## 5. Cycle 2 deliverables (this audit)

- ✅ Confirmed all 11 W356-W384 modules have complete UI coverage
- ✅ Identified naming inconsistency as the only worth-flagging issue
- ✅ 3 explicit options with cost/risk trade-offs for user decision
- ✅ Out-of-scope items called out (broader 158-dir inventory) as separate Cycle if needed

**Next user decision**: pick A, B, or C for the naming inconsistency. Or defer it and move to a different Cycle 3 item.
