- ✅ Pushed to GitHub (d3999179 backend, e16b8e0 ERP)
- ✅ Verified on GitHub repositories

### Files Deployed

```text
Backend Repository (alawael-backend):
  ├── .alawael/
  │   ├── config/alawael.config.json (35 lines)
  │   ├── README.md (150 lines)
  │   └── logs/
  ├── .github/workflows/alawael-health-check.yml (50 lines)
  └── .gitignore (updated)

  ├── .alawael/
  │   ├── config/alawael.config.json (45 lines)
  │   ├── README.md (180 lines)
  │   └── logs/
  ├── .github/workflows/alawael-health-check.yml (40 lines)
  └── .gitignore (updated)
```

### What Happened

All infrastructure was automatically deployed to GitHub repositories. Both repositories now have:

- Configuration templates for deployment automation
- README documentation for teams
- GitHub Actions workflows for periodic health checks
- Properly configured .gitignore for sensitive files

### Next Step

Proceed to Phase 2 (GitHub Configuration)

---

## 📖 Phase 2: GitHub Configuration

### Estimated Duration

**30-45 minutes** (manual GitHub UI configuration)

### What You'll Do

Configure GitHub settings that enable automated Phase 3-4 deployments:

#### 2.1 Branch Protection (10 min per repo)

For both `alawael-backend` and `alawael-erp` repositories:

**Backend Repository:**

1. Go to: Settings → Branches → Add protection rule
2. Branch name pattern: `main`
3. Enable:
   - ✅ Require pull request reviews before merging (1 approval)
   - ✅ Require status checks to pass before merging
   - ✅ Require branches to be up to date with base
   - ✅ Require code reviews from code owners
4. Click "Create"

**ERP Repository:**

1. Same steps as above, but for `main` branch

#### 2.2 Environment Configuration (5 min per repo)

1. Settings → Environments → New environment
2. Create 3 environments:
   - `development` (no approval required)
   - `staging` (requires environment secrets)
   - `production` (requires 2+ approvals)
3. Add deployment branches for each

#### 2.3 GitHub Secrets Configuration (10 min per repo)

For both repositories, add these secrets:

**Backend Secrets:**

```text
GITHUB_TOKEN          = [Fine-grained personal access token]
SONAR_TOKEN          = [SonarCloud token]
SNYK_TOKEN           = [Snyk API token]
DEPLOY_TOKEN         = [AWS CodeDeploy token]
SLACK_WEBHOOK        = [Slack webhook URL]
DATABASE_PASSWORD    = [Encrypted]
```

**ERP Secrets:** Same authentication tokens

#### 2.4 Teams & Permissions (15 min organization-level)

Create 4 teams at organization level:

```text
1. alawael-admins (Admin access)
   └─ Members: CTO, VP Eng, DevOps Lead

2. alawael-developers (Write access)
   └─ Members: Backend engineers (5), ERP engineers (3)

3. alawael-ops (Maintain access)
   └─ Members: DevOps engineers (2), Database engineers (2)

4. alawael-security (Read access)
   └─ Members: Security engineer (1), Compliance officer (1)
```

### Automated Helper Script

Optional: Use `alawael-github-phase2-setup.sh` (300+ lines) for partial automation

```bash
bash alawael-github-phase2-setup.sh
```

### Verification Checklist

- [ ] Branch protection enabled on `main` (both repos)
- [ ] All 3 environments created (all repos)
- [ ] 6 secrets configured (both repos)
- [ ] 4 teams created at organization level
- [ ] Team members assigned to correct teams
- [ ] Health-check workflows running (should see status checks)

### Risk Assessment

**Risk: VERY LOW**

- All changes are in GitHub UI (easily reversible)
- No production systems affected
- Can be rolled back by removing protections

---

## 📖 Phase 3: Staging Deployment (Canary Strategy)

### File to Execute

```bash
bash alawael-phase3-staging-deploy.sh
```

### Estimated Duration

**45 minutes** (with monitoring validation)

### What Happens

Deploys v1.0.0 to staging environment using CANARY strategy:

```text
Stage 1:  5% traffic  → Health check → Validate metrics
Stage 2:  25% traffic → Health check → Validate metrics
Stage 3:  50% traffic → Health check → Validate metrics
Stage 4: 100% traffic → Health check → Validate metrics
```

Each stage includes:

1. Deploy to X% of instances
2. Health checks (all endpoints responding)
3. Metrics validation:
   - Response time P99: <500ms
   - Error rate: <0.05%
   - CPU: <80%
   - Memory: <85%
   - Uptime: 100%

### Automatic Validation

Script automatically:

- ✅ Validates all metrics at each stage
- ✅ Passes to next stage if metrics OK
- ✅ Rolls back immediately if metrics exceed thresholds
- ✅ Logs all decisions in: `/tmp/alawael-staging-[ID].log`

### Manual Monitoring During Execution

Watch the staging dashboard in real-time:

```text
https://grafana-staging.alawael.company/
```

Key metrics to watch:

- **Response Time (P99):** Should stay <500ms
- **Error Rate:** Should stay <0.05%
- **CPU Usage:** Should stay <80%
- **Memory Usage:** Should stay <85%

### Success Criteria

All 4 canary stages PASS with:

- ✅ Response time P99 < 500ms
- ✅ Error rate < 0.05%
- ✅ No Critical bugs found
- ✅ Team approves proceeding to production

### Post-Stage Validation

After script completes, verify:

```bash
# Check staging metrics
curl https://api-staging.alawael.company/api/health

# Check logs for any issues
tail -100 /tmp/alawael-staging-*.log
```

### Risk Assessment

**Risk: VERY LOW**

- Staging environment only (no production impact)
- Automatic rollback if issues detected
- Can re-run at any time if needed
- Provides safety validation before production

### Rollback (if needed)

If earlier stage fails:

```bash
# Re-run the script (automatic retry logic)
bash alawael-phase3-staging-deploy.sh
```

---

## 📖 Phase 4: Production Deployment (Blue-Green Strategy)

### Prerequisites

- [ ] Phase 2 (GitHub config) COMPLETE
- [ ] Phase 3 (Staging) COMPLETE and PASSED
- [ ] Team approval OBTAINED
- [ ] Change management ticket APPROVED

### Files to Execute

```bash
# 1. Deploy v1.0.0 to production
bash alawael-phase4-production-deploy.sh

# 2. If issues arise (keep ready at terminal)
bash alawael-phase4-production-rollback.sh
```

### Estimated Duration

**30 minutes** (+ 5 minutes post-deployment validation)

### Deployment Timeline

#### T+0: Pre-Deployment (5 min)

- Verify Blue (v0.9.8) is healthy
- Verify staging passed all validations
- Final approval from CTO

#### T+5: Green Provisioning (5 min)

- Provision Greeninfrastructure (5 servers)
- Deploy v1.0.0 to all Green servers
- Run database migrations

#### T+10: Green Validation (5 min)

- Health checks on all Green servers
- Database connectivity verified
- Cache layers populated

#### T+15: Traffic Switch (1 second actual)

- **T+0.3s:** Switch 50% traffic to Green
- **T+0.6s:** Switch remaining 50% to Green
- **T+0.9s:** All traffic now on Green v1.0.0

#### T+20: Post-Switch Validation (5 min)

- Response time metrics
- Error rate validation
- CPU/Memory monitoring
- Database synchronization

#### T+25: Deployment Complete

All traffic on v1.0.0 (Green)  
v0.9.8 (Blue) standing by for 24 hours

### Live Monitoring Dashboard

During execution, watch:

```text
https://grafana.alawael.company/
```

Key windows to monitor:

1. **Deployment Progress:** Shows phase status (pre → switch → post)
2. **Green Health:** Real-time response times & error rates
3. **Traffic Distribution:** Blue/Green split (should be 0%→100%)
4. **Database Status:** Replication lag & connection health

### What to Expect During Switch

**Perfectly Normal:**

- Brief increase in latency (< 100ms extra) - expected during switch
- Few new connections on Green - normal cache warm-up
- CPU spike on Green (5-10 sec) - expected during traffic shift
- Some session timeout (users reconnect < 5 sec) - expected

**Indicators of Problem (Trigger Rollback):**

- Response time P99 > 1000ms - PROBLEM
- Error rate > 1% - PROBLEM
- CPU stuck above 85% for > 1 min - PROBLEM
- Database replication lag > 5 min - PROBLEM

### Instant Rollback Procedure

If issues detected during/after deployment:

```bash
# IMMEDIATE: Execute rollback
bash alawael-phase4-production-rollback.sh

# This will:
# 1. Capture Green diagnostics
# 2. Switch traffic back to Blue (v0.9.8)
# 3. Blue takes over immediately
# Duration: < 30 seconds
```

Rollback is **INSTANT** - all traffic back to Blue < 30 seconds

### Post-Deployment Checklist

After Phase 4 completes:

- [ ] All 5 Green servers healthy
- [ ] 100% traffic on Green
- [ ] Blue sitting idle (ready for rollback)
- [ ] Metrics within SLA
- [ ] No errors in logs
- [ ] Team standing by for Phase 5

### Risk Assessment

**Risk: VERY LOW**

- Blue environment untouched (instant fallback)
- Zero-downtime switch (< 1 second)
- Automatic metrics validation
- Team trained on rollback procedure
- Runbook ready for any issues

**Symptom:** Script not progressing, servers not responding

**Fix:**

```bash
# Kill running script
CTRL+C

# Check Green server status
curl https://green.alawael.company/health

# Likely cause: DNS cache delay
# Solution: Wait 30 seconds, re-run script
bash alawael-phase4-production-deploy.sh
```

### Issue: Metrics Threshold Exceeded in Phase 4

**Symptom:** Green error rate > 1%, response time P99 > 1000ms

**Fix (IMMEDIATE - ROLLBACK):**

```bash
# Execute rollback immediately
bash alawael-phase4-production-rollback.sh

# This switches all traffic back to Blue (v0.9.8)
# Duration: < 30 seconds
# Result: Service restored
```

### Issue: Phase 5 Monitoring Finds Critical Issue

**Symptom:** Hourly check shows metric threshold exceeded

**Fix:**

```bash
# Check what triggered alert
grep THRESHOLD /tmp/alawael-monitoring-*.log

# If can be fixed (e.g., cache issue):
#  1. Fix the issue
#  2. Re-run validation

# If requires rollback:
bash alawael-phase4-production-rollback.sh
```

### Issue: Blue Environment Won't Shutdown (Phase 6)

**Symptom:** Some Blue servers still running

**Fix:**

```bash
# Manually force shutdown
aws ec2 terminate-instances --instance-ids i-xxx i-yyy i-zzz
