## 🎯 Quick Start - Staging Deployment (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Copy Staging Environment (2 minutes)

```bash
# Navigate to backend
cd erp_new_system/backend

# Copy staging configuration
cp .env.staging .env.staging  # Already copied
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies (3 minutes)

```bash
npm install
# Dependencies installed for:
# - Redis caching client
# - Email SMTP support
# - SMS Twilio client
# - Push notification FCM
# - Analytics collectors
```

### Step 3: Start Backend on Port 3001 (2 minutes)

```bash
# Set environment to staging
$env:NODE_ENV = "staging"

# Start the backend
npm start

# Expected output:
# ✅ Server running on http://localhost:3001
# ✅ Mock DB initialized (no MongoDB required)
# ✅ Cache layer ready (Redis optional)
# ✅ Security hardening active
# ✅ Analytics dashboard initialized
# ✅ Notifications service ready
# ✅ Feature flags loaded
```

### Step 4: Verify Advanced Features (5 minutes)

```bash
# Run advanced features integration tests
npm test -- advanced-features.integration.test.js

# Expected: 50+ tests passing
# Coverage: Cache, Security, Analytics, Notifications, Feature Flags
```

### Step 5: Start Frontend on Port 3000 (3 minutes)

```bash
# In another terminal
cd supply-chain-management/frontend
npm start

# Expected output:
# ✅ Frontend running on http://localhost:3000
# ✅ Service Worker registered
# ✅ PWA cache initialized
# ✅ API connected to backend
```

## 🔧 Detailed Configuration

### Redis Caching (Optional but Recommended)

```bash
# If Redis not installed, skip this section
# REDIS_ENABLED=true in .env requires Redis running on port 6379

# Install Redis (Windows via WSL or Docker)
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:latest

# Or use Redis Cloud (free tier)
# Update REDIS_HOST in .env.staging to your Redis Cloud URL
```

### Email Notifications

```env
# In .env.staging, configure Gmail SMTP
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_FROM=your_staging_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_USER=your_staging_email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your_app_specific_password  # Not Gmail password!

# How to get Gmail app password:
# 1. Enable 2-factor authentication on Gmail account
# 2. Go to https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
# 3. Select Mail → Windows Computer
# 4. Copy generated password to EMAIL_PASSWORD
```

### Feature Flags Configuration

```env
# Enable/disable features for staging testing
ENABLE_ADVANCED_ANALYTICS=100          # 100% = all users
ENABLE_REAL_TIME_SYNC=80               # 80% = gradual rollout
ENABLE_DARK_MODE=100
ENABLE_ADVANCED_SEARCH=0               # 0% = disabled
ENABLE_RECOMMENDATIONS=0               # Disabled for testing
ENABLE_NOTIFICATIONS_V2=60             # 60% = A/B test cohort
```

### Security Configuration

```env
# Rate Limiting
MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS=5                   # Lock after 5 failed
LOCKOUT_DURATION=900000                # 15 minutes
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW=900000               # 15 minute window
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100            # Max 100 requests

# Encryption (Change for production!)
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_encryption_key_staging_change_in_production
ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHM=aes-256-cbc
```

## 🧪 Manual Testing Workflows

### Test Cache Layer

```bash
# Create cached endpoint call
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token"

# Verify response is cached (should be faster on repeat)
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/products \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token"

# Check logs for cache hit
# Expected: "Cache HIT: products_list"
```

### Test Security Hardening

```bash
# Test input sanitization
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/search \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"<script>alert(\"xss\")</script>"}'

# Expected logs:
# "Input sanitized: <script> → [filtered]"

# Test password validation
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"test","password":"weak"}'

# Expected: 400 Bad Request
# Message: "Password must contain 8+ chars, uppercase, lowercase, number, special"
```

### Test Analytics Dashboard

```bash
# Generate some API traffic
for i in {1..10}; do
  curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/products
  sleep 1
done

# Get analytics dashboard
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/dashboard?timeRange=minute

# Expected response includes:
# - apiStats: array of endpoints with call counts
# - errorStats: error counts by type
# - performanceMetrics: response times
# - healthRecommendations: optimization suggestions
```

### Test Notifications

```bash
# Send test notification
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/notifications/send \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
  -d '{
    "userId":"user123",
    "title":"Test Notification",
    "message":"Testing notification system",
    "channels":["inapp","email"],
    "priority":"normal"
  }'

# Expected: 200 Ok
# Response: { success: true, notificationId: "notif_xxx" }

# Get notification history
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/notifications/history \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token"
```

### Test Feature Flags

```bash
# Check if feature enabled for user
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/features/check?flag=enable_advanced_analytics&userId=user123

# Expected: { enabled: true, percentage: 100 }

# Get all flags
curl -X GET http://localhost:3001/api/features/flags

# Expected: List of all feature flags with percentages

# Create A/B experiment
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/features/experiments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer admin_token" \
  -d '{
    "name":"recommendation_test",
    "variants":["control","variant_a","variant_b"],
    "trafficAllocation":{"control":0.34,"variant_a":0.33,"variant_b":0.33}
  }'
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Issue: Backend won't start

```text
Error: EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3001
```

**Solution:**

```bash
# Find process using port 3001
netstat -ano | findstr :3001

# Kill process (replace PID with actual)
taskkill /PID <PID> /F

# Start backend again
npm start
```

### Issue: Service Worker not registering

```text
Error: Service Worker registration failed
```

**Solution:**

1. Ensure HTTPS or localhost (SW requires secure context)
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify manifest.json exists in public/
4. Clear browser cache and reload

### Issue: Cache layer not working

```text
Error: Redis connection refused
```

**Solution:**

1. Set `REDIS_ENABLED=false` in .env to use in-memory cache
2. Or install Redis: `docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:latest`
3. Check REDIS_HOST matches running instance

### Issue: Notifications not sending

```text
Error: Email service error
```

**Solution:**

1. Verify EMAIL_USER and EMAIL_PASSWORD correct
2. Enable "Less secure apps" for Gmail (if using)
3. Or use Gmail app-specific password
4. Check EMAIL_FROM matches EMAIL_USER
