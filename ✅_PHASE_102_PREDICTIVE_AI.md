# Phase 102: Predictive Recovery AI Engine

## Status: ✅ Complete & Verified

**Date:** January 15, 2026
**Verified By:** `tests/verify_phases_102.js`

## Overview

Phase 102 adds "Sight of the Future" to the system. It uses the aggregated data from the **Clinical Command Center (Phase 101)** to mathematically model the patient's recovery trajectory.

## Core Features

1.  **AI Recovery Model (`EXPERIMENTAL_RECOVERY_NET_V4`)**:
    - Calculates "Learning Velocity" based on:
      - Physical Compliance (Robotics/Sensors).
      - Cognitive Progression (Smart Cognitive Unit).
    - Estimates days/weeks until "Full Recovery" (Target Level 10).

2.  **Scenario Analysis**:
    - Automatically generates "What If" scenarios.
    - _Example:_ "If we switch to Intensive Protocol, recovery time drops from 13 weeks to 9 weeks."

3.  **Integration**:
    - Consumes data from Phase 101.
    - Provides data to Therapist Dashboards for long-term planning.

## Significance

The system moves from being **Reactive** (treating what is wrong now) to **Proactive** (optimizing the path to future wellness).
