### Development Date: January 15, 2026

### Status: **COMPLETE**

## 1. Overview

We have expanded the "Smart Ecosystem" beyond clinical and operational boundaries into **Physical Infrastructure** and **Social Support**, making the system a complete holistic solution for a modern rehabilitation center.

## Phase 47: Smart Facility & Energy (Green Rehab)

**"The Sustainable Center"**
This module turns the physical building into a smart asset that optimizes costs and equipment uptime.

### Key Features:

1.  **Eco-Friendly Scheduling:**
    - _Logic:_ Suggests scheduling high-energy water therapy during "Solar Peak" hours (e.g., 10 AM - 2 PM).
    - _Impact:_ Reduces electricity bills and carbon footprint.
    - _Tech:_ `SmartFacilityService.getEcoFriendlySlots`
2.  **Robotic Predictive Maintenance:**
    - _Logic:_ Monitors telemetry (vibration, heat) from rehab robots (Lokomat, Armeo).
    - _Impact:_ Prevents sudden breakdowns of expensive equipment.
    - _Tech:_ `SmartFacilityService.checkEquipmentHealth`
3.  **Smart Room Utility:**
    - _Logic:_ Automatically "turns off" virtual HVAC/Lights for unbooked rooms in the schedule.

## Phase 48: Secure Peer Support & Community

**"The Social Safety Net"**
Recognizing that rehabilitation is a journey for the whole family, this module provides a safe, curated space for parents.

### Key Features:

1.  **AI Matchmaking for Support Groups:**
    - _Logic:_ Matches parents based on Child's Diagnosis + Age Group + Location.
    - _Example:_ "Parents of CP children aged 3-5 in Riyadh".
    - _Tech:_ `SmartCommunityService.findSupportGroup`
2.  **AI Content Moderation:**
    - _Logic:_ Real-time scan of forum posts to block PII (Phone numbers) and "Dangerous Medical Advice" (e.g., "Stop meds").
    - _Impact:_ Creates a safe, medically responsible environment.
    - _Tech:_ `SmartCommunityService.moderateContent`
3.  **Equipment Exchange (Reuse/Recycle):**
    - _Logic:_ Integration for families to donate/trade outgrown equipment (Wheelchairs/Walkers), vetted by PTs.
