# 🎉 2026 DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES - THE "BACK OFFICE" UPDATE

We have reached **40 Phases**.
We have now fortified the "Boring but Critical" back-office systems to enable true enterprise management.

## 🚀 The Operational Pillars (Jan 15 Update)

### 1. 💹 Advanced Financial Core (Phase 39)
-   **Double-Entry Journal:** Replaced simple billing with real accounting standards (Debits/Credits).
-   **Service Profitability:** "Cost Center" analysis. It tells you which department (Speech vs OT) makes money and which loses money after allocating rent & electricity.

### 2. 👥 Strategic HR Core (Phase 40)
-   **Contract Lifecycle:** Proactive 60-day alerts for contract renewal or termination.
-   **One-Click Payroll:** Combines [Base Pay] - [Lateness] + [Overtime] + [AI Performance Bonus] into a single payout slip.

### 3. 📢 Unified Notification Center
-   **Smart Dispatch:** Knows that appointment reminders go to **WhatsApp**, but Invoices go to **Email**. Fallback to SMS if internet is down.

## 🌐 Complete System Status (40 Modules)
The system is now a towering skyscraper of functionality:
-   **Base:** Strong Finance/HR Core (Phases 39-40).
-   **Ops:** Intelligent Scheduling & Capacity (Phase 19).
-   **Care:** World-class Clinical AI (Phase 32).
-   **Edge:** IoT, Telehealth & Mobile Apps (Phase 36).

Current Status: **READY FOR IPO/ACQUISITION GRADE**.
The software now manages every single atom of the rehabilitation center's existence.
