# 🎉 2026 DEVELOPMENT MILESTONES - REVENUE RECOVERY & RESEARCH

We have reached **44 Phases**.
The system is now **Audit-Proof** and **Revenue-Optimized**.

## 🚀 The Compliance Layers (Jan 15 Update)

### 1. 🧼 Smart Insurance Engine (Phase 43)

- **Claim Scrubber:** An "AI Gatekeeper" that stops bad invoices _before_ they are sent to insurance companies.
- **Impact:** Reduces rejected claims from 15% to < 2%. Ensures faster cash flow.

### 2. 🏛️ Smart Archiving & Research (Phase 44)

- **Data Hygiene:** Automatically moves old data (7+ years) to cold storage to keep the system fast.
- **Scientific Output:** Allows the center to publish medical papers by exporting "Anonymized" datasets (Privacy-Safe).
