## 🌐 System Architecture

The backend is now structured into **3 Layers**:

1.  **Core CRUD:** Basic storage (Users, Sessions).
2.  **Logic Layer:** Dedicated Services (e.g., `PayrollService`, `GoalsService`).
3.  **Intelligence Layer:** `Smart*Service` classes that sit on top and automate decisions.

## 🚀 Next Steps

The Backend "Brain" is fully formed.
To bring this to life, we recommend:

1.  **Frontend Integration:** Connecting React/Vue to these 30+ endpoints.
2.  **Real AI Integration:** Replacing "Mock" logic with actual `OpenAI` or `Python` microservices.
3.  **IoT Hardware:** Connecting physical fingerprint scanners or turnstiles.
